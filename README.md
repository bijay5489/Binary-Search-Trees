# Binary-Search-Trees
ApptBook ADT Implementation:
Implement ApptBook using a BST for this assignment.
Do not implement the removeCurrent operation this week.
Handle duplicates by inserting them into the right subtree of equivalent elements.
Use a cursor for navigation, which starts at the leftmost node and moves according to specific rules depending on the presence of right children or not.
Cursor Navigation:
Navigate using a cursor starting from the leftmost node.
Two navigation cases based on the cursorâ€™s node right child presence.
Helper Methods:
Implement a series of recursive helper methods for operations like checking tree height, counting nodes, and finding elements.
These methods are crucial for implementing main ADT methods like clone and insert.
Tasks:
Understand and unlock tests for helper methods.
Define the data structure and implement the Node class.
Implement helper methods and validate them using internal tests.
Use helper methods to implement wellFormed and cursor-related operations.
Implement insert method and later the clone method using recursive helper methods.
Lastly, implement insertAll differently to avoid unbalanced trees.
Testing:
Validate your implementation using a series of JUnit tests provided.
Efficiency tests should confirm that your implementation runs within acceptable time limits.
Assignment Strategy:
Start early due to the complexity and reliance on recursion.
Use the provided skeleton and test suites from your Git repository.
